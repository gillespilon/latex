The essence of overfitting is to have unknowingly extracted some of the residual variation (that is, the noise) as if that variation represented underlying model structure. The possibility of over-fitting exists because the criterion used for selecting the model is not the same as the criterion used to judge the suitability of a model. For example, a model might be selected by maximizing its performance on some set of \gls{trainingdataset}, and yet its suitability might be determined by its ability to perform well on unseen data; then over-fitting occurs when a model begins to \enquote{memorize} \gls{trainingdataset} rather than \enquote{learning} to generalize from a trend. As an extreme example, if the number of parameters is the same as or greater than the number of \glspl{observation}, then a model can perfectly predict the \gls{trainingdataset} simply by memorizing the \glspl{datum} in its entirety. Such a model, though, will typically fail severely when making predictions.}
